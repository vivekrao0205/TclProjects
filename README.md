## 1 - PassGen

PassGen is a simple and lightweight **password generator built using Tcl scripting language**.  
It creates secure, random passwords using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

### Features

-  Generates random secure passwords  
-  You can set password length  
-  Uses alphabets, numbers, and symbols  
-  Lightweight and no external packages required  
-  Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

###Example :
Enter password length: 12
Generated Password: kD@9t#L2sP1!

## RC Low-Pass Filter Calculator

A simple command-line Tcl script to calculate the **cutoff frequency (fc)** of an RC Low-Pass Filter.
An RC Low-Pass Filter allows low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating high-frequency signals.  
The cutoff frequency is given by:

Fc = i/2Πrc

Where:
- **R** = Resistance in ohms (Ω)  
- **C** = Capacitance in farads (F)  
- **fc** = Cutoff Frequency in Hertz (Hz)

---
### Sample output 

Enter Resistance (R) in ohms: 1000
Enter Capacitance (C) in farads (e.g., 0.000001 for 1uF): 0.000001
RC Low-Pass Filter Result 
Resistance (R): 1000 ohms
Capacitance (C): 0.000001 farads
Cutoff Frequency (fc): 159.154943 Hz

---------------------------------
in this way we can make any cal using tcl scripts , this is a very easy scripts lets drive in more complex scripts.
